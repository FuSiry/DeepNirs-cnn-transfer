"The slogan of ICNIRS2021 in Beijing is“Sense the Real Change”, meaning that we will sense the various spectral information of NIR, the development of spectral theory and chemometrics, the enhanced performance of instruments and measurement accessories. We also hope that every participant can personally sense the real changes in China, including the historical charm and modern atmosphere. And you can feel the passion of Chinese near-infrared researchers for NIR spectroscopy."———Excerpt from ICNIRS2021
